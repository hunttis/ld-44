# Hunttis' Ludum Dare 44 compo entry

The pesky druids are at it again. Rummaging around for something to worship they've woken you up! They'll all pay!

Eat all the druids to advance the levels.

Arrow keys to control, up jumps and while in the air, pressing down will smash down and stun an enemy.

Using powers costs you health. Eating druids replenishes your health.

You can restart a level by pressing R. You can skip a level by pressing 9.

Done alone in 48h (compo mode) using:
- Code is Haxe using HaxeFlixel (VSCode)
- Graphics with PixelMator (the moon) and Pixaki on the iPad (all the rest)
- Levels made with Tiled
- Music is done with a ukulele, a ukulele bass and Garageband on iOS
- Sounds are made with Chiptone
